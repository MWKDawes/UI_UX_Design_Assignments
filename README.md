# UI_UX_Design_Assignments
### This repository contains a few different projects that I think were fun to design and also were early in my designing career, so may come off as a bit old-fashioned. However, some of the clients, such as the Grand Canyon Hikers, supplied a stylesheet that were stuck to and still turned out well despite seeming a bit amateur.

## 3 Website Layout
This folder contains three separate websites that were used to practice Boostrap coding in fixed, fluid, and responsive formats.

##Canyon Hikers Website
This was a project to create a mockup for a "Canyon Hikers" enthusiast website to entice people to join a club for Grand Canyon hikers. I created a logo for the site and was asked to make a main webpage design using the color and stylesheet provided and include an "about", "gallery", and "contact" section.
