                <p class="lead">Derry is a fictional town in the U.S. state of Maine that has served as the setting for a number of Stephen King's novels, novellas, and short stories,
                     notably It. Derry first appeared in King's 1981 short story "The Bird and the Album" and has reappeared as recently as his 2011 novel 11/22/63.</p>

                    <p>Morton Rainey, a successful novelist in Derry, Maine, is confronted by a man from Mississippi named John Shooter, who claims Mort plagiarized a story he wrote.
                         Mort vehemently denies ever plagiarizing anything. Shooter leaves, but not before leaving his manuscript, "Secret Window, Secret Garden". Mort throws the 
                         manuscript into the trash can. When his housemaid recovers the manuscript—thinking it belongs to Mort—he finally reads Shooter's story, discovering that it
                          is almost identical to his short story "Sowing Season". The only differences are the title, the character's name, the diction, and the ending. Mort is
